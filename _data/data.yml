    - role: Consultant - Java Developer
      time: Apr 2021 - Jan 2023
      company: Open Reply, Bari, Italy
      details: |
        As a Java Back-End Developer, I had the privilege of contributing to a multifaceted wealth management platform 
        within the financial domain. One of the key defining features of this platform was its system integrator nature, 
        which posed both challenges and strengths to the development process.
        One of the primary challenges was seamlessly integrating a multitude of third-party systems, 
        each communicating through REST APIs and SOAP APIs. The complexity of ensuring smooth interactions between these 
        systems required a meticulous approach and a deep understanding of API integration methodologies.
        Another significant challenge stemmed from the nature of the financial domain itself. 
        The platform dealt with a substantial and diverse volume of data, necessitating efficient handling, 
        processing, and management. Successfully addressing this demand was critical to ensure optimal performance 
        and user experience.
        Throughout the development process, we adhered to a rigorous methodology. 
        It always commenced with a comprehensive requirement analysis to gain a thorough understanding of the 
        project's objectives. From there, we meticulously designed, implemented, and rigorously tested solutions, 
        employing tools like Mockito and JUnit 5 to ensure the robustness and reliability of our codebase.
        In this dynamic environment, my expertise in Java 8 and the Spring ecosystem, particularly Spring Data, 
        Spring Boot, Spring Batch, and Spring Web, played a pivotal role in delivering effective solutions. 
        Additionally, I skillfully worked with Oracle DBMS, leveraging its capabilities to enhance data management and integration.
        Working with a cross-functional team, I fostered a collaborative and supportive work environment, 
        valuing effective communication and teamwork. This approach proved instrumental in overcoming challenges 
        and achieving shared objectives.
        As an ardent advocate of continuous learning, I constantly sought opportunities to stay abreast of industry 
        trends and emerging technologies. My commitment to growth and technical excellence enabled me to make valuable 
        contributions to the wealth management platform, resulting in enhanced performance and user satisfaction.
        I take pride in my role as a Java Back-End Developer, and I eagerly look forward to leveraging 
        my expertise to drive innovation and success in future projects. 

    - role: Researcher - Full Stack Developer
      time: May 2018 - Nov 2018
      company: Directa Lab, Conversano, Italy
      details: |
        As a versatile Full Stack Developer, I have contributed to a wide array of projects, spanning web, mobile, 
        and IoT applications. Among these, the most substantial undertaking was a BPM (Business Process Management) System.
        A significant challenge I successfully tackled involved devising an interactive solution that empowered end users 
        to efficiently set up and model internal business processes, leveraging a graph visualization tool. 
        This achievement not only streamlined workflows but also enhanced overall productivity for the system's users.
        Throughout this journey, I leveraged a diverse technology stack, incorporating Python Django framework, 
        Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Java 8, and MySQL. My proficiency extended to both Windows and Linux operating systems, 
        seamlessly adapting to diverse development environments.
        Whether working independently or as part of a team, I consistently adopted Test Driven Development methodologies, 
        ensuring robust and reliable codebases. My commitment to producing high-quality solutions and my passion for 
        staying abreast of the latest technological advancements have been key drivers in my journey as a Full Stack Developer.
        I take pride in my adaptability, enabling me to embrace new challenges with enthusiasm and deliver results.
        My experiences have instilled in me a strong appreciation for collaborative work, effective communication, 
        and the value of continuous learning, making me a versatile and dedicated professional ready to take on new opportunities.
